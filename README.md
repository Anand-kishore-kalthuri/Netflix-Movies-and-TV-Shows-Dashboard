Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dashboard


Project Overview
This section gives a brief introduction to the project. It explains that the goal is to create an interactive
Power BI dashboard to analyze Netflix data. The focus is on understanding key aspects like the distribution of
titles (movies and TV shows), their popularity, ratings, and genres. The dashboard is a tool for exploring trends
and insights in Netflix's vast content library.



Features
1. Content Analysis
Provides a breakdown of how many movies and TV shows belong to different genres, ratings, and popularity levels.
Helps identify trends like which genres are most common or which have the highest ratings.

2. Global Trends
Uses map visualizations to show how Netflix content is distributed across countries.
Includes metrics like the number of titles produced in a country, their average ratings, and the total number of votes.

3. Dynamic Filtering
Allows users to filter the data interactively in real time.
Filters include genres, ratings, type (movie or TV show), and country of origin, enabling a customized exploration.

4. Detailed Information
A detailed table shows the specifics of each title, including:

Title name
IMDb rating
Number of votes
Genre(s)
Cast members
Summary/Plot
Content rating (e.g., PG, R)
This feature helps users get detailed insights into any specific title.

Dataset Details
This section describes what the dataset contains. The dataset provides information about Netflix's movies and TV shows.
It includes the following:

Title: Name of the movie or TV show.

IMDb Rating: Average rating of the title on IMDb.

Votes: Number of votes the title has received on IMDb.

Genre: Categories like Drama, Comedy, or Action that describe the content.

Runtime: Duration of the movie or episode(s).

Country of Origin: The country where the title was produced.

Language: The language of the title (e.g., English, Spanish).

Plot: A brief description of the storyline or synopsis.

Other Details: Includes cast members, type (movie/TV show), and year of release.

This dataset serves as the backbone of the analysis and visualization.


Tools & Technologies
This section explains the tools and methods used to develop the project:

Power BI: The primary tool used for creating the interactive dashboard. Power BI allows for visualizing complex data in a user-friendly way.

Power Query: Used to clean and preprocess the data before it is visualized.

Dataset Source: Refers to the custom dataset used in the project, containing information about Netflix's titles.

Insights Gained
This section highlights the key findings from the project:

Popular Genres: Discovered which genres are most common and which ones have higher ratings.


Country Analysis: Analyzed how many titles were produced by each country and their average performance (ratings and votes).


Content Relationships: Explored patterns, such as whether longer runtimes correspond to higher ratings or whether TV shows outperform movies.


How to Use the Dashboard
Step-by-Step Instructions:

Open the Power BI File: Download and open the provided .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.

Explore Filters: Use the slicers on the dashboard to filter the data based on parameters like genres, ratings, type (movie or TV show), and country of origin.

Hover for Details: Hover over different visuals (like maps and bar charts) to view additional tooltips with detailed insights.

Interact with Tables: Scroll through the table view to see detailed information about individual titles, such as their plot, cast, and rating.


Future Enhancements
This section outlines potential improvements for the project:

Trending Data: Incorporate dynamic data to show real-time updates about newly released Netflix titles or trending shows/movies.

User Recommendations: Add features to recommend content based on user preferences or historical viewing patterns.

Advanced Filters: Improve filtering options, such as allowing users to filter by multiple languages or combine filters (e.g., "Movies in Spanish with a rating above 8").


What's This About?
Imagine Netflix dropped all its data in your lap: every movie, every TV show, ratings, countries, genres, and more. What do you do with it? You create a cool dashboard in Power BI to make sense of it all.

This dashboard is like a Netflix detective tool. It helps us figure out:

What kind of content Netflix has.
Which genres and countries are dominating.
How ratings and votes vary between movies and TV shows.
And if you're curious about a specific movie or show, you can find its details too!
What’s in the Dashboard?
Big Picture Numbers:

Total Netflix titles: How many movies and TV shows are there in total?
Ratings: What’s the average rating of all Netflix content? Movies vs. TV shows?
Country Insights:

A world map shows which countries produce the most Netflix titles.
You can see each country’s average rating and total number of votes.
Genres:

A chart shows how many titles are in each genre (like Drama, Comedy, or Thriller).
You can also see the average rating for each genre, so you know which ones people like the most.
Top Titles:

There’s a table where you can search for specific movies or shows. For example, you type Breaking Bad, and it shows you:
The rating (amazing, of course!).
The plot (chemistry teacher turned meth-maker).
The cast and other details.
What Did You Use?
To make all this magic happen, you used Power BI, which is like a super tool for turning raw data into something visual and interactive. You also cleaned up the data (because no dataset is perfect) using Power Query.



What Does the Data Look Like?
Think of the data like an Excel sheet with columns for everything:

Title: The name of the movie or show.
Rating: How people rated it (out of 10).
Votes: How many people rated it.
Genre: Whether it’s Drama, Comedy, or something else.
Country: Where the title was made.
Plot: A short summary of the movie or show.
Type: Is it a movie or a TV show?



What’s the Cool Part?
The interactive filters! You can:

Click to focus on only one country (like the USA or India).
Filter by genres, ratings, or even runtime.
Explore data for either movies or TV shows.
Let’s say you want to know:
"What are the best-rated TV shows made in South Korea?"
You just click on South Korea, filter for TV shows, and sort by rating. Bam! There’s your answer.



Why Is This Useful?
Think of this as a tool for Netflix analysts or anyone curious about trends in movies and TV shows. It gives insights like:

Which genres or countries perform the best?
What people love watching (based on ratings and votes).
Trends in movie vs. TV show performance.
And for you, Anand, this project is an amazing showcase of your skills in:

Data visualization (making this beautiful dashboard).
Data cleaning (getting the dataset ready for analysis).
Storytelling with data (showing Netflix trends and insights).



What’s Next?
You could add some advanced stuff in the future, like:
Live updates: Add real-time data so it’s always fresh.
Recommendations: Suggest movies/shows based on user preferences.
Deeper filters: For example, find "Spanish comedies with a rating above 8."



Why Is This Project Awesome?
Because it’s simple, interactive, and super informative. Anyone from a Netflix fan to a business analyst can use it. Plus, it’s a perfect way for you to show off your Power BI and data analysis skills!
