Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dashboard


Project Overview
This section gives a brief introduction to the project. It explains that the goal is to create an interactive
Power BI dashboard to analyze Netflix data. The focus is on understanding key aspects like the distribution of
titles (movies and TV shows), their popularity, ratings, and genres. The dashboard is a tool for exploring trends
and insights in Netflix's vast content library.



Features
1. Content Analysis
Provides a breakdown of how many movies and TV shows belong to different genres, ratings, and popularity levels.
Helps identify trends like which genres are most common or which have the highest ratings.

2. Global Trends
Uses map visualizations to show how Netflix content is distributed across countries.
Includes metrics like the number of titles produced in a country, their average ratings, and the total number of votes.

3. Dynamic Filtering
Allows users to filter the data interactively in real time.
Filters include genres, ratings, type (movie or TV show), and country of origin, enabling a customized exploration.

4. Detailed Information
A detailed table shows the specifics of each title, including:

Title name
IMDb rating
Number of votes
Genre(s)
Cast members
Summary/Plot
Content rating (e.g., PG, R)
This feature helps users get detailed insights into any specific title.
